# 🩸 Lifeline — Blood Donation Management System

Lifeline is a centralized web-based blood donation system designed to bridge the gap between **blood donors** and **hospitals**. Built using HTML, CSS, and PHP, this project was an academic prototype aimed at streamlining the blood donation process, improving emergency response, and enhancing communication between parties involved.

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

The Lifeline system allows hospitals and donors to register, view appointments, and hospitals to respond to blood requests. The platform supports core functionalities like booking, canceling, rescheduling appointments, and maintaining a donor record history.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- **Donor Registration/Login**  
  Basic donor authentication to access and manage their blood donation history.

- **Hospital Dashboard**  
  Hospitals can log in to manage blood stocks, request donors during emergencies, and schedule appointments.

- **Appointment Management**  
  Donors can book or reschedule appointments. Hospitals can confirm or modify them based on availability.

- **Blood Request System**  
  Enables hospitals to send out blood requests which are visible to eligible and nearby donors.

- **History Tracking**  
  Donors can view their past donation history, including location, date, and blood group requested.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (pure styling, no frameworks)
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing donor and hospital data)
- **Hosting**: Tested locally on XAMPP during development

## 🚧 Development Notes

- The project was developed as a foundational version of a larger-scale system.
- Focus was placed on simplicity and usability for a student demo.
- Security and real-world deployment aspects (like validation, authentication, scalability) were kept minimal due to academic constraints.
- Future iterations aim to use modern frameworks (React, Node.js, Python) and introduce automation and machine learning for smarter scheduling and matching.

## 📖 Learning Outcome

This project was a stepping stone into web development, giving hands-on experience with:
- Structuring and styling static pages
- Server-side scripting using PHP
- CRUD operations with MySQL
- Understanding real-world problems in healthcare and tech-driven solutions

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Full authentication and role-based access control
- Integrated notification system (SMS/email)
- Health evaluation and eligibility logic for donors
- Mobile responsiveness and better UI/UX
- AI-based donor matching during emergencies
